## Recommended Approach

The recommended approach for using **al-folio** is to first create your own site using the template with as few changes as possible, and only when it is up and running customize it however you like. This way it is easier to pinpoint what causes a potential issue in case of a bug.

**For the quickest setup**, follow the [Quick Start Guide](QUICKSTART.md), which will have you up and running in 5 minutes.

### Template vs. Fork: Which Should I Use?

**Use the "Use this template" button** (recommended) when creating your own al-folio site. This creates a clean, independent copy that is not linked to the main al-folio repository.

**If you already forked the repository**, your fork will work fine, but you should be aware of a common pitfall:

- Forks maintain a connection to the original repository, which can make it easy to accidentally submit pull requests to al-folio with your personal site changes
- **Solution:** When making changes to your fork, always create a new branch (e.g., `git checkout -b my-site-updates`) and verify that you're pushing to **your own fork** before submitting pull requests
- Only submit pull requests to `alshedivat/al-folio` if you're intentionally contributing improvements that benefit the entire al-folio community

### Important Notes for GitHub Pages Sites

If you plan to upload your site to `<your-github-username>.github.io`, the repository name :warning: **MUST BE** :warning: `<your-github-username>.github.io` or `<your-github-orgname>.github.io`, as stated in the [GitHub pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites).

When configuring `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and leave `baseurl` **empty** (do NOT delete it), setting it as `baseurl:`.

### Automatic Deployment

Starting version [v0.3.5](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/tag/v0.3.5), **al-folio** will automatically re-deploy your webpage each time you push new changes to your repository! :sparkles:

### Local Development

Once everything is deployed, you can download the repository to your machine and start customizing it locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
```

See [Local setup](#local-setup) below for local development options.

## Local setup on Windows

If you are using Windows, it is **highly recommended** to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which provides a much smoother Ruby/Jekyll setup than native Windows. You can follow [these instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support) to install WSL and Ubuntu on your machine.

## Local setup

Use the native Ruby/Jekyll toolchain for local development.

You need to take the following steps to get `al-folio` up and running on your local machine:

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).
2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and `pip`.
3. Install ImageMagick.
4. Install project dependencies and start the site:

```bash
bundle install
pip install -r requirements.txt
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

To see the template running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4000`.

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!). Also, your changes should be automatically rendered in real-time (or maybe after a few seconds).

## Deployment

Deploying your website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is the most popular option.
Starting version [v0.3.5](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/tag/v0.3.5), **al-folio** will automatically re-deploy your webpage each time you push new changes to your repository **main branch**! :sparkles:

### For personal and organization webpages

1. The name of your repository **MUST BE** `<your-github-username>.github.io` or `<your-github-orgname>.github.io`.
2. In `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and leave `baseurl` empty.
3. Set up automatic deployment of your webpage (see instructions below).
4. Make changes to your main branch, commit, and push!
5. After deployment, the webpage will become available at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.

### For project pages

1. In `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and `baseurl` to `/<your-repository-name>/`.
2. Set up automatic deployment of your webpage (see instructions below).
3. Make changes to your main branch, commit, and push!
4. After deployment, the webpage will become available at `<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.

### Enabling automatic deployment

1. Click on **Actions** tab and **Enable GitHub Actions**; do not worry about creating any workflows as everything has already been set for you.
2. Go to `Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions`, and give `Read and write permissions` to GitHub Actions
3. Make any other changes to your webpage, commit, and push to your main branch. This will automatically trigger the **Deploy** action.
4. Wait for a few minutes and let the action complete. You can see the progress in the **Actions** tab. If completed successfully, in addition to the `main` branch, your repository should now have a newly built `gh-pages` branch. **Do NOT touch this branch!**
5. Finally, in the **Settings** of your repository, in the Pages section, set the branch to `gh-pages` (**NOT** to `main`). For more details, see [Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source).

If you keep your site on another branch, open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` **on the branch you keep your website on** and change `on->push->branches` and `on->pull\_request->branches` to the branch you keep your website on. This will trigger the action on pulls/pushes on that branch. The action will then deploy the website on the branch it was triggered from.

### Manual deployment to GitHub Pages

If you need to manually re-deploy your website to GitHub pages, go to Actions, click "Deploy" in the left sidebar, then "Run workflow."

### Deploy on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

1. [Use this template -> Create a new repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=al-folio&template_owner=alshedivat).
2. Netlify: **Add new site** -> **Import an existing project** -> **GitHub** and give Netlify access to the repository you just created.
3. Netlify: In the deploy settings
   - Set **Branch to deploy** to `main`
   - **Base directory** is empty
   - Set **Build command** to `sed -i "s/^\(baseurl: \).*$/baseurl:/" _config.yml && bundle exec jekyll build`
   - Set **Publish directory** to `_site`

4. Netlify: Add the following two **environment variables**
   - | Key            | Value                                                                                  |
     | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | `JEKYLL_ENV`   | `production`                                                                           |
     | `RUBY_VERSION` | set to the Ruby version found in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (for example, `3.3.5`) |

5. Netlify: Click **Deploy** and wait for the site to be published. If you want to use your own domain name, follow the steps in [this documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/).

### Deployment to another hosting server (non GitHub Pages)

If you decide to not use GitHub Pages and host your page elsewhere, simply run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```

which will (re-)generate the static webpage in the `_site/` folder.
Then simply copy the contents of the `_site/` directory to your hosting server.

If you also want to remove unused css classes from your file, run:

```bash
purgecss -c purgecss.config.js
```

which will replace the css files in the `_site/assets/css/` folder with the purged css files.

**Note:** Make sure to correctly set the `url` and `baseurl` fields in `_config.yml` before building the webpage. If you are deploying your webpage to `your-domain.com/your-project/`, you must set `url: your-domain.com` and `baseurl: /your-project/`. If you are deploying directly to `your-domain.com`, leave `baseurl` blank, **do not delete it**.

### Deployment to a separate repository (advanced users only)

**Note:** Do not try using this method unless you know what you are doing (make sure you are familiar with [publishing sources](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites)). This approach allows to have the website's source code in one repository and the deployment version in a different repository.

Let's assume that your website's publishing source is a `publishing-source` subdirectory of a git-versioned repository cloned under `$HOME/repo/`.
For a user site this could well be something like `$HOME/<user>.github.io`.

Firstly, from the deployment repo dir, checkout the git branch hosting your publishing source.

Then from the website sources dir (commonly your al-folio fork's clone):

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build --destination $HOME/repo/publishing-source
```

This will instruct jekyll to deploy the website under `$HOME/repo/publishing-source`.

**Note:** Jekyll will clean `$HOME/repo/publishing-source` before building!

The quote below is taken directly from the [jekyll configuration docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/):

> Destination folders are cleaned on site builds
>
> The contents of `<destination>` are automatically cleaned, by default, when the site is built. Files or folders that are not created by your site will be removed. Some files could be retained by specifying them within the `<keep_files>` configuration directive.
>
> Do not use an important location for `<destination>`; instead, use it as a staging area and copy files from there to your web server.

If `$HOME/repo/publishing-source` contains files that you want jekyll to leave untouched, specify them under `keep_files` in `_config.yml`.
In its default configuration, al-folio will copy the top-level `README.md` to the publishing source. If you want to change this behavior, add `README.md` under `exclude` in `_config.yml`.

**Note:** Do _not_ run `jekyll clean` on your publishing source repo as this will result in the entire directory getting deleted, irrespective of the content of `keep_files` in `_config.yml`.

## Maintaining Dependencies

**al-folio** uses **Bundler** (a Ruby dependency manager) to keep track of Ruby packages (called "gems") needed to run Jekyll and its plugins.

**To update all dependencies:**

```bash
bundle update --all
```

**After updating:**

1. Reinstall gems if needed: `bundle install`
2. Test locally to ensure everything still works: `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
3. Visit `http://localhost:4000` and verify the site renders correctly
4. If your site fails after updating, check the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for troubleshooting

**For Ruby/Python environment issues:**

- Make sure your local Ruby version matches `.ruby-version`
- Re-run `bundle install` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Upgrading from a previous version

If you installed **al-folio** as described above, you can manually update your code by following the steps below:

```bash
# Assuming the current directory is <your-repo-name>
git remote add upstream https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio.git
git fetch upstream
git rebase v0.16.3
```

If you have extensively customized a previous version, it might be trickier to upgrade.
You can still follow the steps above, but `git rebase` may result in merge conflicts that must be resolved.
See [git rebase manual](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/about-git-rebase) and how to [resolve conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/resolving-merge-conflicts-after-a-git-rebase) for more information.
If rebasing is too complicated, we recommend re-installing the new version of the theme from scratch and port over your content and changes from the previous version manually. You can use tools like [meld](https://meldmerge.org/)
or [winmerge](https://winmerge.org/) to help in this process.
